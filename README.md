TODO:

implement bootsrapping  
some working model   
statistical baseline(?)/ find max and cut in 2* std_dev idk  

maybe add decay times?

Xb_TAU: The reconstructed decay time (lifetime) of the $X_b$ baryon.  
Xc_TAU: The reconstructed decay time of the X_c daughter baryon.  
Xb_TAUERR / Xc_TAUERR: The uncertainty on the decay time.   
Xb_TAUCHI2: A statistical measure of how well the decay time fit matches the vertices.
